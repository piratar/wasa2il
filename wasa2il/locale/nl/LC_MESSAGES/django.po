"<p>\n"
"Polities are groups of people who come together to make decisions and "
"enact their will.\n"
"These are given various names depending on their form, structure, intent,"
" scale and scope.\n"
"Therefore they are variously called \"countries\", \"towns\", \"clubs\", "
"\"cabals\", \"mafias\", \"federations\",\n"
"\"treaties\", \"unions\", \"associations\", \"companies\", \"phyles\", "
"\"tribes\", \"counties\", \"regions\", \n"
"or any other of a number of different terms.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"The reason we use the word \"polity\" in Wasa2il is that it is the most "
"generic term we could\n"
"find. It says nothing of the form, the structure, the intent, scale or "
"scope of the group\n"
"of people, nor does it preclude anything. Using the word \"group\" could "
"work too, but it lacks\n"
"the imporant factor that there is an intent to make decisions and enact "
"will.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"In addition to consisting of a group of people, a polity will have a set "
"of laws\n"
"the group has decided to adhere to. In an abstract sense, membership in a"
" polity\n"
"grants a person certain rights and priviledges. For instance, membership "
"in a \n"
"school's student body may grant you the right to attend their annual "
"prom,\n"
"and membership in a country (i.e. residency or citizenship) grants you a "
"right \n"
"to live there and do certain things there, such as start companies. stand"
" in \n"
"elections, and so on.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Each polity has different rules - these are also called statutes, bylaws "
"or laws - \n"
"which affect the polity on two different levels.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Firstly, there are meta-rules, which describe how rules are formed, how\n"
"decisions are made and how governance in general \n"
"happens. Wasa2il has to be flexible enough to accomodate the varying \n"
"meta-rules of a given polity, otherwise the polity may decide that "
"Wasa2il isn't \n"
"useful to them. Sometimes these rules are referred to as \"rules of "
"procedure\" \n"
"or \"constitution\", depending on the type of polity which is using them."
"\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Secondly there are external rules, which are the decisions the polity "
"makes which\n"
"don't affect its internal decisionmaking process.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"It is hard to talk about a term completely in the abstract. We can "
"describe its features, but\n"
"that only gets us so far. So let's look at some of the things that can "
"vary from one polity\n"
"to another, and then take a few examples in each.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h2>Scope</h2>\n"
"<p>\n"
"The scope of a polity determines the range of things that the polity "
"concerns itself with. The\n"
"scope may be a geographic region, a set of ideas, a particular part of "
"social activity, or\n"
"a common interest of its members.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"<i>La Casa Invisible</i> is a social center in Málaga, Spain, which works"
" in the Málaga region\n"
"to promote ideas of social cohesion, autonomy, and democracy. It operates"
" a café, a book store,\n"
"a music hall, and various other projects, each of which could be "
"considered a sub-polity of\n"
"the social center itself. The scope of La Casa Invisible's actions is "
"mostly bound to decisions\n"
"regarding the social center itself, and the activities that take place "
"within it.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"<i>The Union of the Comoros (Udzima wa Komori)</i> is an island nation to"
" the east of Africa, \n"
"just north of Madagascar. It has a population of 798.000 people living in"
" an area of 2.235km². \n"
"The scope of The Comoros as a polity is the land and national waters they"
" control, their airspace,\n"
"and their foreign trade, defense and other agreements they are party to. "
"As such, they have\n"
"municipal sub-polities, and are a member of the African Union, "
"Francophonie, Organization of Islamic\n"
"Cooperation, Arab League and Indian Ocean Commission superpolities, "
"amongst others.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h2>Scale</h2>\n"
"<p>\n"
"The scale of a polity determines how large it can be expected to become. "
"Some polities are specifically\n"
"structured with intent to grow, while others intentionally try to stay at"
" a constant size.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"<i>Muff Divers</i> is a diving club in the village of Muff in Ireland. It"
" claims to be the fastest\n"
"growing diving club in the world, most likely owing to its name.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h2>Intent</h2>\n"
"<p>\n"
"A polity is created around intent. Some polities intend to take over the "
"world, others intend to make\n"
"the nicest cupcakes in all of the land. Some polities intend to send "
"people into space, and others\n"
"intend to track down and arrest criminals. Polities have all sorts of "
"motives and intents.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"On the most basic level, a polity's intent is a description of what it "
"intends to do. This has nothing\n"
"to do with whether the polity has the ability to do it, or whether "
"anybody or anything - such as another\n"
"polity, or the laws of physics - stand in their way.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"<i></i>\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h2>Structure</h2>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Representative democracy, direct democracy, participatory democracy, "
"dictatorship. There are lots of terms\n"
"which describe the structure of a polity. In one sense, it refers to "
"where in the structure of relations\n"
"between people the authority lies. In a dictatorship, one person has "
"ultimate authority, although he may\n"
"choose to grant some authority downstream to trusted advisors, who in "
"turn have trusted advisors, and so\n"
"on. In a fully egealitarian system, each individual is equipotent, "
"meaning he has an equal ability to\n"
"everybody else to instigate decisions - however, it depends on the "
"structure what ability the individual\n"
"has to actually complete the decision making.\n"
"</p>\n"
